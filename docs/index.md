# Welcome to CoPerception

CoPerception is an open-source library for collaborative multi-agent perception.
It supports **detection**, **semantics segmentation**, and **tracking** tasks on models including [V2VNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07519), [When2com](https://github.com/GT-RIPL/MultiAgentPerception), and [DiscoNet](https://github.com/ai4ce/DiscoNet).  

CoPerception currently only supports the [V2X-Sim](https://ai4ce.github.io/V2X-Sim/index.html) dataset: A Comprehensive Synthetic Multi-agent Perception Dataset.  

Note that CoPerception is in its very early stages of development. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please submit an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coperception/coperception/issues).
